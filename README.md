My exercise to implement a basice AWS Data FireHose and Splunk Cloud.

Lastk week, I mistakenly installed Splunk Enterprise to my local laptop then realized there was now way AWS Firehose was going to connect to my laptop.
Also, the splunk enterprise quickly made me run out of disk space.

I transitioned to a 14-day Splunk Cloud account, but have had errors about dropped or failed connections.

Troubleshooting.
